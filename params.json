{"name":"gztest","tagline":"A distributed testing framework for gazebo.","body":"gztest\r\n======\r\n\r\ngztest is a distributed testing framework for gazebo. It features an architecture, that splits the test execution and the gazebo core from each other. The communication is done via JSON-RPC. The software consists of a serverside system plugin, that fetches all the testable features from the running gazebo world. On the clientside however, you have a library that handles the communication with the gazebo core and provides ease-to-use methods for useful test-conditions like \"Object A on B?\" etc.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
